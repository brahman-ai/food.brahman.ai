Tongbaechu-kimchi, Bombay Beach style.

This recipe is mainly based on Maangchi's traditional napa cabbage kimchi. Her website is an excellent resource for all sorts of Korean cooking. She has been sharing her recipes online and on YouTube for long enough that I am somewhat of a Maangchi loyalist when it comes to learning Korean recipes online. I have gotten feedback from Korean friends with opinions whenever possible.

While in Bombay Beach, we made two large batches of kimchi for each house to share - the first time without the rice porridge which included a vegan version. It was less complex in ingredients and flavor, but both times used the same whole-cabbage preparation technique and both were delicious. We never had fermented shrimp paste on hand, but I normally skip that anyway because honestly I'm afraid of spilling it in my house and having to move out.

EQUIPMENT:

    2 x 2 gallon jars with plastic lids to store the kimchi. You can use a traditional onggi, or any container with a tight fitting lid.
    Large bin for soaking/washing cabbage.
    Food-safe gloves. Unless you don't mind your hands getting very stained, spicy, or otherwise smelly.
    Food processor. Makes the mincing/chopping etc go by much faster. Totally optional though very helpful if you're making a large batch.

INGREDIENTS:

    2-3 napa cabbages of medium size (about 12 inches tall) ~ 6lbs.
    1/2 cup kosher salt. Good to have extra on hand.
    2 cups julienned daikon radish *optional
    1 cup julienned carrots *optional

For the porridge:

    2 cups water
    2 Tbsp glutinous rice four
    2 Tbsp sugar

For the paste:

    12 scallions, roughly chopped

The following ingredients can be tossed into a food processor together if you have one instead of mincing by hand.

    1/2 cup garlic cloves, minced
    2 tsp ginger, minced
    1 medium yellow onion, minced
    1/2 cup fish sauce *if making vegan, substitute with 1/2 cup konbu dashi & 2 Tbsp dulse flakes.
    2 cups gochugaru - Korean red pepper flakes


PART 1 - PREP THE NAPA. There is a 2 hour rest time at the end of this which is fairly passive - use this time to do Part 2.

    Cut each napa lengthwise into quarters so that the leaves stay attached.
    Give each quarter a quick dip/rinse in water. This will help the salt stick.
    Salt the napa leaves one at a time starting with the outer layer: without breaking off the leaves, spread an even layer of salt on the inside of each leaf. Use more at the thicker stems - I like to give it a firm but gentle massage on these spots.
    Let salted sections rest in a tub or large bowl for 2 hours. You will notice that the salt helps to draw out water in the napa. Every 1/2 hour during the resting you should flip the sections over, redistributing its own liquid. By the end of this process the napa quarters should be limp and translucent.

PART 2 - MAKE THE PORRIDGE & KIMCHI PASTE.

    Combine 2 cups of water and 2 Tbsp of glutinous rice flour in a small pot. Cook over medium heat until it bubbles, about 10 mins.
    Add 2 Tbsp sugar and continue stirring for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.
    In a bowl, combine the cooled porridge, scallions, garlic, ginger, onion, fish sauce, and gochugaru. Mix well, forming a thick paste.
    Combine paste with julienned daikon and carrots.

PART 3 - STUFF THE NAPA.

    Wash the napa that has been salted. Be thorough, since it hasn't really been washed properly yet. I did this in a huge bin with a garden hose in the yard which was excessive but very effective fun. Be careful not to break off too many leaves from the core - some parts will come off, just add them into the kimchi paste! When you taste the napa after washing it should taste salty, but not too salty.
    Put some gloves on at this point if you haven't already. Or be ready for the consequences of having hands soaked in hot pepper.
    Using the same method as the salt application, spread the kimchi paste over each leaf. After you finish stuffing each section, wrap it snuggly around itself and place in the jar.
    When packing the jar, press down to force air out between layers. It should be tightly packed down. Do not overpack your jar - it can explode from gas being produced during fermentation. Plastic lids will help prevent this from happening, as will releasing some of the excess gas as necessary.

STEP 4 - WAIT.

    Store in a cool dark place for at least 2 days. This can be flexible - longer fermentation will produce a deeper and more complex flavor. You should see tiny bubbles forming during this process.
    I suggest taking out a sample to taste as you let it ferment. Once it's to your liking, store it in the fridge. It will continue to ferment in the fridge, just at a much slower pace. You can also experiment by using multiple vessels so you can enjoy some immediately while the rest gets funkier.
