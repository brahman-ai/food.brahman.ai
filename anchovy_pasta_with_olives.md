# anchovy pasta with olives

## story
I made this a few nights at Brahman 2020 at Pirates and it seemed relatively popular? I lived in Animal House but everybody cooked at Pirates so ya. I think I restocked anchovies at this grocery store at Niland we used to shop at? Maybe on the way back from Slab City. Because I had cooked this once and people seemed to like it and well, didn't want to mess with success. I also bought generic brand Spam over there and made myself spam and rice... yeah that recipe isn't worth posting. - @derekxkwan

## general ingredients (in rough proportions)
- half a jar of marinara sauce
- half a can of pitted black olives
- 2 tins of anchovies (because c'mon, one isn't enough)
- package of pasta (spaghetti works, linguini also works)
- 3-4 cloves of garlic (or garlic powder)
- 3-4 roma tomatoes (because I am cheap and these are the cheapest)
- smoked paprika (my cheat when I want something to have a lil' more depth)
- dried oregano
- dried basil (I can't remember if this was at Pirates)
- salt
- pepper
- red pepper flakes (I can't remember if this was at Pirates either but I like adding red pepper flakes to everything)
- whatever other spices are around (I think there was like this garlic/oregano powder mix laying around?)
- capers (opt, I tend to make them without capers but I've seen recipes with capers)
- some sort of cheese for topping optional (I tend to use parmesan but you do you, I think I brought some of the dry powdery stuff down)
- cooking oil (I tend to use olive oil for these sorts of things but you do you)

## directions
1. boil your water for your pasta in a pot. you know, the normal amount of pasta boiling water.
2. chop up your garlic cloves (if not garlic powder, you can't chop that up I don't think). i've found that cutting both ends off and then cutting through the middle of the clove lengthwise makes it easy to get peel off all the garlic stuff you usu don't want to cook.
3. drain anchovy tins and chop up your anchovies in little bits. don't have to be too little but ya know, little. note that anchovies in tins tend to be oily oily so have appropriate hand wiping things nearby like say, a pair of pants.
4. drain olive can and chop up your olives
5. chop up your tomatoes in lil' cubes. 
6. in a pan (big enough for the marinara sauce + all other ingredients), heat up your oil and cook the anchovies. I like to let them sit for a good long while.
7. add your garlic to the pan. stir em around a lil so they don't get all burnt and egh.
8. after a lil' bit, add the olives. I also like these to sit for a good bit.
9. whenever the water is boiling, add your pasta and cook to whatever firmness you want. i tend to like al dente but ya.
10. add the half jar of tomato sauce and give things a good stir. don't have to really worry about the garlic getting burnt anymore at this point.
11. add in your all your spices to taste and salt and what not, tomatoes, and maybe capers if you got them and let this sit for a while. watch out for bubbling sauce because I mean, that just gets annoying to clean. The tomatoes tend to now disappear bc roma tomatoes don't really do that.
12. tadaaaaaa. it's done. dole out pasta servingns and put the pan stuff on top of the pasta stuff and mix around and stuff.
13. I tend to like to top my pasta with the cheese, and then add more red pepper flakes and more pepper on top but you do you.
